    <h3>Remembering a master.</h3>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mark Carter had been making jerky for more than a decade out of his facility in
        Indio, CA. He marketed it via word of mouth and sold locally, but if you emailed him directly,
        you could get Carter's deep wood jerky shipped straight to you. Mark Carter started his jerky
        from London Broil, and added to it a special marinade he had perfected over the years.
        After marinating the meat, Mark brushes on another layed of sauce before smoking it over two types of woods.
        Carter's beef jerky is among the best the world has ever seen, with rich almost cheesy notes lingering past the initial
        worcestershire flavor. Mark Carter passed away in recent years. His jerky will forevr be remembered.
